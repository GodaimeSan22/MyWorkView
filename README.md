## üåü Overview

The **Monday.com Enhanced Board Data Viewer** is a powerful custom application designed to revolutionize how you interact with your Monday.com board data. Say goodbye to scattered information and hello to a unified, dynamic, and highly interactive view of your projects!

Built seamlessly into the Monday.com platform, this app allows you to aggregate, filter, and even *edit* data from multiple boards in one central, intuitive table. Whether you're a project manager, a team lead, or just someone who needs a clearer overview, this app is engineered to streamline your workflow and enhance your decision-making.

## ‚ú® Key Features

This application isn't just a viewer; it's a dynamic data hub packed with capabilities:

* **üìä Multi-Board Data Aggregation**: Consolidate items and columns from as many Monday.com boards as you need into a single, cohesive table. Get a holistic view across departments or projects.
* **‚öôÔ∏è Dynamic Column Selection**: Take full control! Easily choose which specific columns from your selected boards you want to display in the main data table via a smart, customizable sidebar.
* **üíæ Persistent User Settings**: Your preferences matter. The app intelligently saves your selected boards, columns, and sidebar visibility to Monday.com's app storage, ensuring your personalized setup is instantly loaded every time.
* **üîÑ Real-time Data Refresh**: Stay up-to-date effortlessly. The application periodically fetches the latest data from your Monday.com boards, so your view is always current.
* **‚úèÔ∏è Inline Editing**: Boost your productivity! Directly edit item names and various column values (like status, text, numbers, etc.) right within the table interface.
* **üë§ "My Tasks" Quick Filter**: Instantly filter the table to show only items assigned to *you*, helping you focus on your personal workload.
* **üõ°Ô∏è Robust API Handling**: Experience reliable performance. The `useMondayAPI` hook includes sophisticated error handling with an exponential backoff retry mechanism, gracefully managing Monday.com API rate limits and concurrency issues.
* **üß≠ Intuitive Sidebar**: A dedicated, responsive sidebar offers a smooth experience for configuring visible boards and columns, including convenient "Select All" / "Deselect All" options.
* **üé® Native Monday.com UI**: Leveraging `@vibe/core` components, the app blends seamlessly with the Monday.com ecosystem, offering a familiar and polished user interface.

## üõ†Ô∏è Technologies Used

This project is built with modern web technologies, ensuring high performance, maintainability, and a delightful developer experience:

* **[React](https://react.dev/)**: The powerful JavaScript library for building dynamic and interactive user interfaces.
* **[Vite](https://vitejs.dev/)**: A blazing-fast build tool that significantly improves development speed with its instant server start and hot module replacement.
* **[monday-sdk-js](https://monday.com/developers/apps/sdk/js)**: The official Monday.com JavaScript SDK, providing seamless interaction with the Monday.com API and platform features like app storage.
* **[GraphQL](https://graphql.org/)**: The query language used for efficient and flexible data fetching and manipulation with the Monday.com API.
* **[@vibe/core](https://monday.com/developers/apps/sdk/vibe-react)**: Monday.com's own React UI component library, providing pre-built components (Table, Button, Checkbox, Avatar, Dialog, etc.) for building native-looking apps.
* **CSS**: Styled with plain CSS, leveraging Monday.com's design variables for consistent theming and component appearance.

## üöÄ Installation and Local Development

Get this project up and running on your local machine in just a few steps:

1.  **Clone the Repository:**
    ```bash
    git clone
    ```

2.  **Install Dependencies:**
    ```bash
    npm install
    # or yarn install
    ```

3.  **Set up Environment Variables (Optional but Recommended):**
    Create a `.env` file in the root of your project. While many Monday.com app views can run locally without explicit keys if configured correctly in the Dev Center's "Development URL," this file is crucial for sensitive data like API keys or secrets for server-side components, if your app were to expand.

    Example `.env` (adjust if your app specifically requires these for local dev):
    ```dotenv
    # VITE_APP_MONDAY_CLIENT_ID=your_monday_client_id_here
    # VITE_APP_MONDAY_SIGNING_SECRET=your_monday_signing_secret_here
    # Add any other environment variables your app might consume (e.g., VITE_API_URL)
    ```

4.  **Start the Development Server:**
    ```bash
    npm run dev
    # or yarn dev
    ```
    Your application will typically launch at `http://localhost:3000`. Keep this URL handy for Monday.com app configuration.

## ‚öôÔ∏è Monday.com App Configuration

To bring your powerful app to life within your Monday.com workspace, you need to register it in the Monday.com Developer Center:

1.  **Access the Developer Center**: Navigate to `https://monday.com/app/developer/apps`.
2.  **Create a New App**: Click the `Create new app` button.
3.  **Configure App Details**:
    * **App Name & Description**: Give your app a catchy name and a clear description.
    * **Features**: Select the relevant feature for your app (e.g., `App View` to embed it in a board, or `Dashboard Widget`).
    * **Development URL**: For local development, set this URL to where your local server is running (e.g., `http://localhost:3000`). This tells Monday.com where to load your app from.
    * **Production URL**: When you're ready to deploy, you'll update this with the publicly accessible URL of your hosted build.
    * **API Scopes**: This is critical! Grant your app the necessary permissions to interact with your Monday.com data. Based on the app's functionality, you'll need at least:
        * `boards:read` (to fetch boards, columns, items)
        * `boards:write` (to update item names and column values)
        * `users:read` (to fetch user details for filters like "My Tasks")
        * `account:read` (to get the current user's ID)
        * `storage:read` and `storage:write` (to persist app settings)
    * **Save Changes**: Don't forget to save your app configuration!

After these steps, you can add your development app to any Monday.com board or dashboard and start exploring its capabilities!
